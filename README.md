**Welcome to the Prelude Detect Workshop!** 

Prelude Detect enables any organization to ask questions about their security systems. Those questions will be delivered continuously, through Verified Security Tests (VSTs), and will elicit intelligence in an actionable, quantitative way.

This workshop will teach you how to use Prelude Detect platform and to author your own VSTs.
